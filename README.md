🎭 Facial Expression Recognition using CNN-LSTM & OpenCV
🚀 Overview
This project is an advanced real-time facial expression recognition system built using a powerful CNN-LSTM deep learning model. The system is designed to classify emotions from facial expressions into seven categories:

Angry
Disgust
Fear
Happy
Neutral
Sad
Surprise
It leverages OpenCV for real-time face detection and TensorFlow/Keras for accurate emotion classification, making it an exciting application in the realm of computer vision!
