# 🎭 **Facial Expression Recognition using CNN-LSTM & OpenCV** 

## 🚀 **Overview**
This project is an advanced **real-time facial expression recognition system** built using a powerful **CNN-LSTM** deep learning model. The system is designed to classify emotions from facial expressions into seven categories:  
- **Angry**
- **Disgust**
- **Fear**
- **Happy**
- **Neutral**
- **Sad**
- **Surprise**

It leverages **OpenCV** for real-time face detection and **TensorFlow/Keras** for accurate emotion classification, making it an exciting application in the realm of computer vision!

## 🔍 **Model Architecture**
This project combines CNN and LSTM for accurate facial expression recognition:
- **CNN layers**: Extract high-level features from facial images.
- **Batch normalization**: Improves stability during training.
- **LSTM layer**: Captures temporal dependencies for emotion recognition.
- **Fully connected layers**: Classify emotions into seven categories.
